  "core_goals": [
    "Provide automated data pipeline monitoring with continuous data quality checks.",
    "Enable real-time reporting and visualization of data health metrics and ML model performance.",
    "Detect and alert on data quality issues, schema drift, and ML model drift quickly and accurately.",
    "Support deployment of sample ML models with live inference and drift monitoring.",
    "Deliver an easy-to-use dashboard for data engineers, ML engineers, and data scientists.",
    "Containerize and document the deployment process for scalable and portable use."
  ],
  "key_features": [
    "Data ingestion and ETL pipelines supporting CSV upload and public API connections, with transformation logging.",
    "Continuous data quality analysis for missing values, duplicates, data type mismatches, schema drift, and outlier detection.",
    "A React-based frontend dashboard displaying data quality metrics, health scorecards, trend charts, and historical logs.",
    "ML model deployment with live performance dashboards including accuracy, F1 score, and drift metrics, leveraging Evidently AI for drift detection.",
    "Alert system delivering email and in-app notifications for failed data checks and model performance drops.",
    "Secure basic authentication (optional for MVP) and authorized access control.",
    "Containerized deployment via Docker Compose, with environment configuration and deployment docs."
  ],
  "user_flow_summary": [
    "User uploads or connects a tabular data source (CSV or API) and initiates ETL processing.",
    "System performs continuous data quality checks and logs metrics to PostgreSQL.",
    "User views real-time dashboard with data quality health, active models, datasets, and alerts.",
    "ML engineers deploy a sample model; dashboard displays live inference and drift detection metrics.",
    "Alerts trigger upon data issues or model drift and notify users via email and in-app.",
    "Users manage application settings and monitor recent activity through the dashboard interface."
  ],
  "validation_criteria": [
    "Users can onboard data sources and view data quality issues within 5 minutes.",
    "Critical alerts are triggered within 60 seconds of data quality or model drift events.",
    "Dashboard loads key metrics in under 5 seconds on average for smooth user experience.",
    "Data transformations and metrics logging are accurately recorded in the database.",
    "Live model metrics and drift detection correctly reflect real-time system state.",
    "Authenticated access restricts dashboard and data storage to authorized users only (if enabled)."
