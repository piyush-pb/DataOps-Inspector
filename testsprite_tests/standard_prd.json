    "Deploy and monitor ML models with real-time performance tracking, drift detection, and visualization of feature and prediction distribution shifts.",
    "Trigger multi-channel alerts including email notifications and in-app dashboard alerts for data quality failures and model performance degradation.",
    "Deliver a user-friendly, interactive frontend dashboard for data health scorecards, trend analysis, and system monitoring.",
    "Containerize all components for easy deployment and scalability using Docker Compose.",
    "Implement basic authentication and secure data handling to restrict access to authorized users as part of MVP security. "
  ],
  "key_features": [
    "Data ingestion supporting CSV file uploads and external API connections with automated ETL pipelines.",
    "Continuous data quality monitoring including detection of missing values, duplicates, schema drift, data type mismatches, and outliers.",
    "ML model deployment and live inference dashboard displaying performance metrics such as accuracy and F1 score, integrated with scikit-learn and Evidently AI for drift detection.",
    "Multi-channel alert system providing email alerts and in-app notifications for critical data or model issues.",
    "Interactive dashboard built with React and Material-UI featuring real-time metrics, charts (using Chart.js/Recharts), and historical logs.",
    "Settings interface for configuring email alerts, thresholds, and system parameters.",
    "PostgreSQL backend with SQLAlchemy ORM ensuring robust data storage and schema design.",
    "End-to-end Docker Compose setup including backend, frontend, ML pipeline, and database services for seamless deployment."
  ],
  "user_flow_summary": [
    "Data Engineer uploads a CSV or connects to a data source, configures ETL, and views quality metrics on the dashboard with continuous monitoring.",
    "ML Engineer deploys a scikit-learn model, monitors inference results, observes drift metrics and receives alerts on performance degradation.",
    "Analytics Lead or Manager accesses real-time dashboards to review data health, trends, and alerts before strategic decision meetings.",
    "System Administrator configures alerting parameters, email settings, and system thresholds via the settings management interface.",
    "Users interact with notifications from email or in-app alerts, and drill down into logs and visual charts for detailed issue diagnosis."
  ],
  "validation_criteria": [
    "Users can onboard data sources and visualize data quality issues within 5 minutes.",
    "Alerts for data quality failures or model drift are triggered within 60 seconds of issue detection.",
    "Dashboard loads key metrics and visualizations in under 5 seconds with responsive interactivity.",
    "ML model drift detection accurately identifies distribution shifts using Evidently AI or statistical checks.",
    "Email and in-app notifications are reliably delivered according to configured thresholds and event triggers.",
    "System authentication restricts access appropriately where enabled, ensuring data security.",
    "Docker container services deploy and communicate correctly according to the multi-service architecture."
